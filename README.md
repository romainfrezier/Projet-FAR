1st year project in **C** language at Polytech Montpellier. Carried out by [Romain Frezier](https://github.com/romainfrezier) and [Etienne Tillier](https://github.com/etienne-tillier).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The aim of this project is to implement a distributed application using the concepts seen in class. The application must consist of a server and a client. The server must be able to handle several clients simultaneously. The client must be able to communicate with the server, sending requests and receiving responses.

## ðŸ“¨ Purpose

Implementation of a messaging system on a local network in C language in pairs. The project took the form of a sprint, in which certain functionalities were imposed, and a deliverable was due at the end of each sprint. The last sprint left us free to choose which functionalities we wanted to implement.

## ðŸš€ Run

To launch the server, go to the server folder and run the script `scriptServeur.sh` with the command `./scriptServeur.sh`.

To launch the client, go to the client folder and execute the `scriptClient.sh` script, with the server's IP address as parameter. For example: `./scriptClient.sh XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX`.
